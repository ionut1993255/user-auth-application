Welcome to my "User Auth" application !!!

The purpose of this application is to allow the user to login with pre-existing credentials and 
allow the user to change his password after the login phase.

If the user does not posses the proper credentials, he is obligated to create an account.

I stored the password in Firebase Auth with the help of "POST" method.

I used HTML5, CSS3, JS ES6, React and React Router DOM in order to implement the logic of the application.

Check out the custom favicon *wink *wink

Hope you enjoy !!!
